# Project 1

Part 1 – Main 

The product owner wants to change the marketing strategy based on customers’ behavior.

1. We need to build a custom purchase funnel based on the tracking data, the funnel will 
show the customer journey from the moment of visiting the website, and viewing a 
product or listing, to the moment of purchase. The main marketing funnel steps you can
add or define yourself. Your main goal is to find details on every stage of the marketing 
funnel.
2. The achieved result must be fixed in metrics that, in your view, describe the user 
behavior on the site.
3. What additional data/information would you need to know the effectiveness of the 
current strategy?
4. The resulting analytical solution should show how the customer journey varies 
depending on what page_type was visited first in the session.

Deliverables: 
• The achieved result must be presented in form of a report/dashboard with any suitable 
BI tool. 
• Calculations are done in SQL or Python.
• The results of the analysis and the logic of the calculations should be presented to the 
product team informatively and to be understandable to the entire team, which 
includes technical and non-technical specialists.

Part 2 - SQL

1. Write an SQL query that will return a number of clients by day that:
- only viewed products in their first session;
- added only one product to the basket;
- placed an order within two days time after the first session.
- 
2. Write a query that will return any abnormal (to our view) user behavior. Describe why 
the behavior is unusual.
